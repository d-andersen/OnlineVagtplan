#### DM571 Software Engineering Fall 2019 - Project Part 2 - LocalCinema Case Study

This project aims to implement a simple duty roster for a local cinema.

The system has the following features:

- A login system allowing for new users to be created and for registered users to log into and out of the system.

- Listing all users in the system.

- Support for groups. Groups can be created and deleted, and users can be members of any number of groups, including none at all. The system also lists all groups.

- An event calendar, which displays events such as a movie showing.

- Events for the event calendar can be created, edited, and deleted. In addition, different types of shifts can be associated with an event.

- Support for different shift types, such as Ticket Selling, Candy Selling, Movie Operation and more. Shifts can be created, edited, and deleted, but must always be associated with an event.

- Users can sign up for shifts and cancel their signup as well.

- There is also an [OpenAPI](openapi.yaml) specification, although this has not been implemented.

The project was made using Python 3.6.8 and Django 2.2.7 and the application has now been archived.

Below are some screendumps of the application, demonstrating some of the functionality.
